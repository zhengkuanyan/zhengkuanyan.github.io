        <div class="overview">
          <p class="overview-text">ChineseMe is an online learning website designed for beginners and committed learners to learn authentic Chinese language. Their courses are episode-based. I worked for them as a UX designers to design an effective learning experience for each episode. I was responsible for interaction design and interface design and conducting user testing using prototype. This website is under development now and will soon be launched. </p>

          <h1>THE BACKGROUND</h1>
          <h2>Learning Chinese is Becoming Trendy</h2>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              As China's economy is growing faster than ever, learning
              Chinese has never been so trendy. ChineseMe is one of the
              players in the online Chinese learning market that is devoted
              to bringing authentic value to people learning Chinese.
              Since June 2017, ChineseMe started to create its online
              Chinese learning product and I collaborated with them as a
              product designer to launch the first version of the website.
            </p>

            <h1>THE PRODUCT</h1>
            <h2>Introducing ChineseMe</h2>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>ChineseMe is an online learning course website
              for beginners to learn Chinese. Users can go through well-designed
              course episodes and learn Chinese step by step from characters,
              words, grammar, dialogs, to exercise.
            </p>
            <h3>Develop your learning pathway through well-designed episodes</h3>
            <p>Users can develop systematic language skills as they study
              each episode that features certain topic.

          <h1>THE VISUAL LANGUAGE</h1>
          <h2>Make Design Consistent and Pleasing</h2>
          <div class="body-text">
            <h3>UI kits to increase consistency</h3>
            <p>I developed a set of UI elements to make the design of the whole website more consistent. I tried to strike a balance between a feeling of "professional" and "delightful". So as for the choice of style, I avoided too childish and gamified design, but at the same time not too rigid and boring. And these UI elements served as a good tool to communicate with the developer.
            </p>
            <img class="product-screen" src="./img/chineseme/uikit.png" alt="uikit">
            <h3>Eposode illustrations incease pleasure</h3>
            <p>Also, I created illustrations for each episode according to the theme of that episode in order to better present the basic idea of the content. Users also found that this design gave them a bit more incentives to unlock the new episodes.
            </p>

          <h1>THE OUTCOME</h1>
          <h2>Getting Ready for Launch</h2>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              After I finished final interface design, this project went to development. The product is now in beta. They invited more users to the testing site and receiving feedback on improvement.
